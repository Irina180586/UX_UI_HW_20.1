                    <h4>Project Overview</h4>
                    <p>Pollution Probe is a nonprofit group that seeks to improve Canadian's health through research,
                        education, promotion and advocacy of actions to reduce pollution. As UX/UI designers we worked
                        with our client Sabah Ibrahim to create a digital experience that will encourage people to
                        become a part of the community and foster support networks to assist the organization’s
                        initiatives.
                    </p>
                    <div class="row image-row">

                    <h6>The problem</h6>
                    <p>The Pollution Probe’s current webaite design is outdated and cluttered with content that doesn’t
                        communicate the organization’s mission statement clearly.
                    </p>
                    <h6>The solution</h6>
                    <p>Re-designing the existing content-heavy website to a minimal, visually communicative one with a
                        clear brand statement.
                    </p>
                    <h6>My role & process</h6>
                    <p>I was the user researcher and interface designer in a four-person team. We conducted a multistep
                        UX process along with kick-off meeting, analysis, in-depth research that followed
                        conceptualization, converging on a design, mockup & wireframes, prototype and design validation.
                        We worked collaboratively on each stage of the process.

                    <h4>Research</h4>
                    <p>The research began by assessing the current website to become familiar with its current structure
                        and brand identity. Our research primarily concentrated on the navigation, key features of the
                        website, and visual elements for creating an important brand voice, but were missing in the
                        existing website.
                    </p>
                    <h6>Heuristic evaluation</h6>
                    <p>A heuristic evaluation on the homepage was conducted to assess the current website’s user
                        interface and detect the usability issues that may occur when users interact with the product.

                                <li>Website needs to be worked upon as the current design lacks proper visual accents,
                                    which causes difficulties when browsing the page</li>
                                <li>User control and freedom is not supported. Whatever data user inputs in the sign up
                                    form, website will proceed to the next step and doesn’t allow users to make any

                                <li>The current design lacks aesthetic. It’s out of date and looks unprofessional.
                                    The minimalism of the design is there, but with points mentioned above it doesn’t
                                    work</li>
                                <li>Homepage is cluttered with less than enough information and unnecessary animations

                    <h6>User Interviews</h6>
                    <p>The research process got kick-started by interviewing 5 users interested in environmental
                        conservation to know more
                        about their expectations and the issues they might have faced in the past. The interviews were
                        conducted by asking
                        open-ended questions related to the defined research objectives to gain deep insights.</p>
                    <p>Research goal: To understand what problems and constraints the users have when interacting with
                        environmental
                        organization websites.
                    </p>
                    <p>Interview plan: To identify and learn more about users’ experience, we established three User
                        Research Objectives:

                    <ul class="content_ul">
                        <li>What is user’s motivation to participate in environment protection initiatives?</li>
                        <li>What information do users expect/need to find on websites of environment organizations?</li>
                        <li>What issues users have when they use any website of the environment organizations?</li>

                                <li>Users prefer the non-profits to be either supported by the government or shared with

                                <li>Prior to donating , users want to understand where their money will be allocated and

                                <li>Some environmental websites’ content is overwhelming</li>

                    <h6>Stakeholder interview</h6>
                    <p>Parallelly we also conducted an interview with the Research & Communications Co-ordinator of the
                        Pollution Probe
                        organization. The goal was to understand what areas and sections of the website need to be
                        improved from the agency's
                        perspective.</p>
                    <h6>Major insights</h6>
                    <ul class="content_ul">
                        <li>The website is old and needs an upgrade</li>

                        <li>Cross-functionality needs to be improved</li>

                    <h6>Competitor analysis</h6>
                    <p>The websites of direct competitors were then analyzed to see how they perform on the parameters
                        determined by our
                        research.</p>

                    <p>Based on data and takeaways we gained at Research stage we brainstormed the User’s Insight and Problem statement, uaing

                    <p>“Dianna, a young woman of age 28, is concerned to see the damage that humankind has caused to the Nature. She knows she
                    cannot bring about a big change alone but feels motivated to contribute her bit by actively working with organizations
                    that work for environment conservation. She also wants to share and spread this awareness with her friends and family in
                    hope that her small actions might stir up a wave of change for a better world, to live in, one day.”</p>
                    <h6>Problem statement</h6>
                    <p>Environmentally concerned individuals who are eager to take action want to find ways to control/reduce pollution and its
                    ill-effects. However, they feel challenged to find the right agency as a lot of research goes into distinguishing
                    authentic organizations from the fake ones. Given their genuine interest towards environment conservation, they want to
                    make sure that their contribution is actually utilized to make a difference.
                    How might we help environmentally concerned individuals like Dianna access information about the initiatives that they
                    can support to help them achieve their goal of environmental conservation so that their actions encourage more people to
                    get aligned with this goal.

                    <h6>Feature prioritization</h6>
                    <p>As we know our user better, we then went ahead and conducted the “I like, I wish and What if” brainstorming method to
                    generate ideas that we would like to see and also analyze what features we would keep or change on the current website
                    of the organization.</p>
                    <p>We did do voting to identify our top ideas and then arranged them on the basis of their effect and feasibility. The top
                    features that we identified include:</p>

                                <li>Easier and more interactive website for the users</li>
                                <li>Showcase Who and What the organization is all about</li>
                                <li>Featuring the Donation page they currently have and bringing some more emphasis on it on the homepage</li>

                    </div>
                    <h6>Assessing navigation</h6>
                    <p>To assess website’s navigation we used card sorting method. We did an open card sorting in two rounds.
                    The first round concentrated on the placement of different options under different categories and our results were same
                    as the existing website navigation. Then we moved on to see if the existing titles come across as intuitive to the users
                    or not. Eventually, we ended up changing two headings and also removed the duplicate and the redundant options from the
                    navigation to make it more streamlined and usable.</p>

                    <h6>Sitemap</h6>
                    <p>The site map was developed based on the card sorting activity. “Share this page” is one feature that is added to the
                    global utilities of the website. The footer and the social media links are consistent with the existing website.</p>

                    <p>We started the design stage with Lo-Fi wireframing of homepage. We come up with two versions, after that we discussed
                    and voted on the sections that we liked and combined them to form our final homepage wireframe.</p>

                    <h6>Lo-Fi Protorype usability tesing</h6>
                    <p>To identify usability issues early in the process, we conducted one set of user tests on our low-fidelity wireframes.We
                    performed four user testings on our low-fidelity prototype.
                    Objective: To determine wether the redesigned website works as intended or not.</p>
                    <p>During the testing our users aimed to accomplish 3 tasks:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Find further information about the organization</li>
                        <li>Make a donation</li>
                        <li>Share the homepage with a friend</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>All the received from user testings data we analysed and grouped into categories.</p>

                            <p>We iterated our low-fidelity wireframes based on the feedback from the user testing. The major change we made was on the
                            design of the donation page.</p>
                            <p>We changed the content order and streamlined the donation process.</p>

                    <p>Before moving to hi-fi wireframing our team aligned the design concept by creating UI system that encompasses typography
                    system, color pallete, imagery usage, allignment rules, iconography.
                    We decieded to change and offer new logo as current one looks outdated and needs to be refreshed.</p>

                    <p>We conducted second user testing on the high-fidelity prototype with the same tasks as the first user testing. The
                    intention of this test was to determine if the design iteration solved the problems we found from the first round of
                    user tests.</p>
                    <p>Feedback and notes we compiled using Insight Map method, then groupped this data into categories.</p>

                    <p>We found that overall confusion of the donation page has improved, and the concept of the website and messages were now
                    more clear to users.
                    However, some new problems also came up, so we made another iteration.</p>

                    <h4>Evaluation & Future Opportunities</h4>
                    <p>Our final product we present to four senior UX/UI designers. The overall impression was good. It was poinetd out that
                    redesign of the website was well done. Comparing the original version our new version is “a breath of fresh air”. The
                    aesthetics of the UI works well and engaging users. The layout is balanced and has enough qhite space to let the eyes
                    breath.
                    Among things to consider were the problem statement. It’s marked as not quite concise and needs to be reiterated in
                    terms of why the website needs a redesign and how it affects the users</p>
                    <h6>Future Opportunities</h6>
                    <p>Through our research we found out that people are more willing to donate their time and effort before making a monetary
                    donation. So we would look into the possibility of providing volunteering opportunities easily accessible on the
                    website.</p>
                    <p>Work towards the responsive web design for the organization’s website and look into the possibility of building an app
                    to increase interaction between the target audience and the agency.</p>
                    <p>Seek feedback from Stakeholders to evaluate and update our design upto their expecations.</p>
